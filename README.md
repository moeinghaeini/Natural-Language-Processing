# ðŸ“¡ Spam Detection using Natural Language Processing

Hi! This repository contains my project on spam detection, which I developed as part of the [Natural Language Processing](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2024/natural-language-processing-0) course at the University of Milan in 2024.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Information

- **Course title:** Natural Language Processing  
- **University:** University of Milan (La Statale)  
- **Department:** Computer Science  
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Alfio Ferrara  
- **Academic year:** 2023/2024  

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

In this project, I built a spam detection model for SMS messages using the SMSSpamCollection dataset. My goal was to apply classical NLP techniques and ensemble machine learning to distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones (ham).
